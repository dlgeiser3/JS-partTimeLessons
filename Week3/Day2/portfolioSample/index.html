          <br />
          <p>Give him a friend, we forget the trees get lonely too. Let's make a happy little mountain now. Let's put
            some happy trees and bushes back in here. Just let your mind wander and enjoy. This should make you happy.

            Everything's not great in life, but we can still find beauty in it. By now you should be quite happy about
            what's happening here. This is your world, whatever makes you happy you can put in it. Go crazy. This is an
            example of what you can do with just a few things, a little imagination and a happy dream in your heart.
            We'll throw some old gray clouds in here just sneaking around and having fun.
            <br>
            Making all those little fluffies that live in the clouds. You can't make a mistake. Anything that happens
            you can learn to use - and make something beautiful out of it. We don't want to set these clouds on fire. I
            really recommend you use odorless thinner or your spouse is gonna run you right out into the yard and you'll
            be working by yourself.
            <br>
            A fan brush can be your best friend. Only think about one thing at a time. Don't get greedy. Now we can
            begin working on lots of happy little things.

            Don't fight it, use what happens. Maybe there was an old trapper that lived out here and maybe one day he
            went to check his beaver traps, and maybe he fell into the river and drowned. We'll put a happy little sky
            in here. Put it in, leave it alone. You can spend all day playing with mountains. And maybe, maybe, maybe...
